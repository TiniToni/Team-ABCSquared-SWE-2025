Naming Convention:

Use snake_case when making names. Things such as variables or functions should be lowercase.
Classes should be capitalized at the first word. Constants should be in all caps.

Make sure names are descriptive to minimize comment length. Have them be self-explanatory.

Comments:

Use comments when they are absolutely necessary for someone to be able to understand the code or
understand how to work with the code. --> general case

Inline comments should be short and uses #

Block comments should be used at the top of the file to explain what it does. It should be
formatted like this:

'''
Author: the person who made changes
Date: the date it was commited/pushed
Description: what the change was AND what the file does
'''

Try to avoid using block comments unless absolutely necessary

If a process is used more than once, make it into a function.
Try to make your code modular if possible.
